One method of improve running time is to edit `levenshtein_distance()` to take an extra parameter, `threshold`. Where `threshold` is the current minimum edit distance, if the current computation already has a minimum edit distance greater than `threshold`, than the computation of edit distance should abort and go to the next string. Second optimisation is to precompute a prefix tree of words and search the tree using a depth search and recording the current minimum. Once a branch has edit distance greater than current miniumu, all further sub branches should be pruned and should no longer be considered."
